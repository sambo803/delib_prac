# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# p "Please enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp
# puts word.upcase

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.

# puts "Please enter a number:"
# num = gets.chomp
# if num.to_i > 100
#   puts "That's a big number"
# end

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# puts "Please enter a number:"
# num1 = gets.chomp
# puts "Please enter another number:"
# num2 = gets.chomp
# puts num1.to_f + num2.to_f

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

# puts "Please enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp
# puts word.reverse

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.

# puts "Please enter a number:"
# num = gets.chomp
# puts num.to_i * 10

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.

# puts "Please enter two words:"
# word1 = gets.chomp
# word2 = gets.chomp
# puts word1.upcase + " " + word2.upcase

# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.

# puts "Please enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp
# puts word.length

# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.

# puts "Please enter a number:"
# num = gets.chomp
# if num.to_i < 0
#   puts "That's a negative number."
# end

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.

# puts "Please enter two numbers, one at a time:"
# num1 = gets.chomp
# num2 = gets.chomp
# p num1.to_i * num2.to_i

# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.

# puts "Please enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp
# if word.length > 5
#   puts "That's a long word"
# end
